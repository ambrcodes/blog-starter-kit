## Top 5

### Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub

It is my passion to research and identify the root cause of an issue. I really like to challenge myself.

### Help train and onboard new support teammates

I have a passion for leading and teaching. In my current role at Snyk, I train all new employees on the team. I also hold daily ticket review sessions.

### Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders

I think it is important to be involved with Engineering to be able to provide the best experiance to the client and also to keep up to date with known issues.

### Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day

Taking and responding to tickets is one of the most important parts of a role. Customer success is what maintains your clients and should be the primary focus. With a good reputation, you will get far.

### Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel

I enjoy building relationships with clients. Communication is so important. You want your customers to have confidence in your ability to resolve their issues. You also need to ensure the person handling your clients has great communication skills.

## Bottom 5

### Help resolve billing issues for customers

I prefer to be challenged, though I don't mind admin tasks.

### Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites

I feel like this is more for a socail media role.

### Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case

This would be more a sales or Solutions Engineering role.

### Write and maintain support articles and docs pages

I don't mind technical writing, I did this at a previous job. I just prefer the challenges and research.

### Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case

I prefer to teach on live sessions, such as zoom etc.
